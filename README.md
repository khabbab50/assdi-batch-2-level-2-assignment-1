# 👨‍💻 Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `figma` fils. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `tailwind.config.js`, `pakege.json`, `padding`and`margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

## There is also a `figma file` containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
